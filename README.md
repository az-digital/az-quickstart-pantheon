# Arizona Quickstart Composer-enabled Pantheon Upstream 
This upstream is adapted from Pantheon's standard Drupal 9 upstream and works with the Platform's Integrated Composer build process.

Unlike with earlier Pantheon upstreams (e.g. the UA Quickstart Drupal 7 upstream), files such as Drupal Core that you are unlikely to adjust while building sites are not in the main branch of the repository. Instead, they are referenced as dependencies that are installed by Composer.

For more information and detailed installation guides, please visit the Integrated Composer Pantheon documentation: https://pantheon.io/docs/integrated-composer

This upstream is maintained by [Campus Web Services](https://web.arizona.edu) in collaboration with the [Arizona Digital](https://digitial.arizona.edu) team and it tracks the latest stable release of Arizona Quickstart.
